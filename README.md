# ai_mhealth_app

A colleague and I originally started this project as our undergraduate final-year project. I have now forked it to hopefully continue working on it. The vision was to build an AI-powered mHealth application with functional requirements such as remote consultations, health sensitization, medication management, and symptom-based disease prediction.
