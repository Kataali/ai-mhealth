# ai_mhealth_app

This project was originally started by me and a colleague as our undergraduate final year project. I have now forked it to hopefully continue working on it. The vision was to build an AIopowered mhealth application with the functional requirements as remote consultations, health sensitization, medication managemnt and symptom-based disease prediction.
